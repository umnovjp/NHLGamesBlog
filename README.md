# NHLGamesBlog
This code allows user to post NHL game reviews online. First a user will select date then select a game from list. JavaScript code will add game title and summary of goals to the webpage. A user then will enter description of each goal and overall game description in two input located one above another. User cal also click button Print Roster to find players list, who scored or assisted on a goal.  

This script has been developed after another NHL stats page I created earlier: https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLStats. But it is built to post blog online. It has less stats functionality built in. Only rosters and goals, also goals chart. Previous website had data for penalties, faceoffs, shots, blocked shots, goals, missed shots. 

## Live Page 
address is https://umnovjp.github.io/NHLGamesBlog/. 

## Future development
Current version was developed to use express.js to create a new blog. Later, I will use current files to use databases instead of writing to file.
